# Sample Inputs For Multimodal Tests

Put your local test files here (or update paths in `bedrock_harness.yaml`):

- `demo_image.jpg` for image understanding tests
- `demo_video.mp4` for video understanding tests

You can rename files, but then update:

- `multimodal.default_image_path`
- `multimodal.default_video_path`
